## Known issues

It's super early days for the real-time package, so there are a few things you'll want to keep in mind:

- Portals use security-by-obscurity for now. Anyone with your portal ID can join your portal. (We'll address this in [Milestone 2](https://github.com/github/atom-log/blob/1f94a5b7ce6f90d9232d51663c9a6adf728831d6/real-time-collaboration/portals-roadmap.md#milestone-2-authentication-and-presence).)
- When a collaborator is changing text, you may observe that their cursor appears in the wrong place. We are actively working on this, so expect to have a fix :soon:.
- If you're wondering what's coming next, check out the [roadmap](https://github.com/github/atom-log/blob/master/real-time-collaboration/portals-roadmap.md).
- If you notice any issues or have any feedback, please [open an issue](https://github.com/atom/real-time/issues/new) or ping us (@as-cii, @jasonrudolph) in [the #atom channel][#atom channel].
