## Known issues

It's super early days for the teletype package, so there are a few things you'll want to keep in mind:

- Portals use security-by-obscurity for now. Anyone with your portal ID can join your portal. (We'll address this in [Milestone 2](https://github.com/github/atom-log/blob/1f94a5b7ce6f90d9232d51663c9a6adf728831d6/teletype-collaboration/portals-roadmap.md#milestone-2-authentication-and-presence).)
